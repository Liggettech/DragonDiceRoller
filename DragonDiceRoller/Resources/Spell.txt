Affliction Hex~Entropy~Attack~7~Major~14~MAG (Entropy) vs. SP~Vulnerability Hex~You curse a visible target within 30 yards and all other foes within 10 yd of your target. Until the end of the encounter,  those affected by the affliction hex have a -2 penalty to all tests against Spellpower. A primary target who makes a successful Magic (Entropy) test against your Spellpower suffers only a -1 penalty and completely negates the effects on the secondary targets. Secondary targets may also make Magic (Entropy) resistance tests to negate their own penalties entirely, but their individual successes or failures only affect themselves. It doesn't matter whether a given target is a primary or secondary target of an affliction hex; additional castings of the same spell while the original casting's duration persists have no effect on the target (see Stacked Spells and Effects).
Animate Dead~Spirit~Utility~12~1min (4R)~17~None~Virulent Walking Bomb~Potent spiritual energy enters a corpse you touch, causing it to jerk to life at your command. The corpse remains animate for a number of minutes equal to your Magic ability, or until you release the enchantment. Use the stats for the skeletons on page 304 for the animated dead. In special circumstances, the GM may want to devise unique stats instead, to reflect who the corpse was in life.
Anti-Magic Burst~Spirit~Utility~20~Major~20~MAG (Spirit) vs. SP~Anti-Magic Ward~You dispel all magical effects, both harmful and beneficial, within a 20yd radius. Make a Magic (Spirit) test vs. your Spellpower of any affected magic. Make a single roll and apply the results to each magical effect. Success means you remove the effect, while failure means it is too powerful to be dispelled. You may remove some effects and not others, based upon the various Spellpower totals. The GM may rule that some magical effects not created by spells can also be affected by anti-magic burst, in which case he assigns a Spellpower rating to describe the effect's potency.
Anti-Magic Ward~Spirit~Enhancement~10~Major~17~None~Dispel Magic~You ward an ally against harmful magic until the end of the encounter, granting them a +5 bonus to all tests made to oppose or resist Spellpower.
Arcane Bolt~Spirit~Attack~2~Major~10~DEX (Acrobatics) vs. SP~None~A bolt of arcane energy springs from your hand or your staff and streaks towards a visible target within 30 yards. The arcane bolt inflicts 2d6 damage, with bonus damage equal to the casting roll's Dragon Die. If the target makes a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower, the spell only inflicts 1d6 damage.
Arcane Shield~Spirit~Defense~4~Major~14~None~Arcane Bolt~You create an arcane aura around you that deflects attacks. For one round, your Defense becomes equal to your Spellpower (10 + Magic + Focus). You can extend the spell's effect when you cast it by spending 1 MP per additional round you would like it to last.
Aura of Might~Spirit~Enhancement~5~Major~14~None~Arcane Warrior Specialization~Magic flows through the Arcane Warrior, giving them a +2 bonus to damage with melee attacks for one minute.
Blizzard~Primal~Attack~20~Major~17~DEX (Acrobatics) vs. SP~Cone of Cold~This spell conjures forth a blizzard with a 5-yard radius, centered anywhere within 50 yards. Anyone in its howling winds takes 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage and must succeed at a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower or slip and fall prone on the accumulating ice. Targets that start their turn in the blizzard take an additional 1d6 penetrating damage and must make an immediate test to avoid falling prone. All melee attacks made into or from the blizzard suffer a -2 penalty, all such ranged attacks suffer a -5 penalty. This spell normally lasts for one round but for 10 MP, paid at the start of your subsequent turns as a free action, you may extend the duration by an additional round.
Blood Sacrifice~Blood~Enhancement~5~Major~14~None~Blood Mage Specialization~You can draw upon the life force of a willing and visible ally within 20 yards to replenish your own Health. This ally must have blood (no golems, for example). You gain 1 Health for each 1 Health lost by your ally, up to 25. This can result in the subject's death, if reduced to 0 Health. The subject of a blood sacrifice recovers the lost Health normally.
Blood Slave~Blood~Attack~20~Major~19~WIL (Self-Discipline) vs. SP~Hemorrhage~One of the most feared powers available to blood mages, this spell allows you to take complete control of an enemy's body unless they make a successful Willpower (Self-Discipline) test vs. your Spellpower. If the subject fails, you may dictate the actions he takes on their next turn. The subject may attempt a new test to resist you at the start of each of their subsequent turns. Once the target successfully resists, the spell ends. All attacks made by a target under your control suffer a -2 penalty (if the target chooses to resist) due to the imprecise nature of your manipulation. Targets without blood cannot be affected by this spell.
Blood Wound~Blood~Attack~8~Major~17~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Blood Mage Specialization~You make the blood of all enemies within 12 yards of you boil, causing excruciating pain. All targets take 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage and must make a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower. Those that fail can only take a minor action on their next turns. Targets without blood or some similar substance are not affected by this spell. Golems are not affected, for example, while wild sylvans are affected through their sap. Insubstantial and incorporeal targets like shades and ash wraiths are also not affected.
Chain Lightning~Primal~Attack~15~Major~17~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Tempest~Lightning leaps from your outstretched hand or staff to a target of your choice within 30 yards. It then arcs to up to five secondary targets of your choice within 10 yards of the primary target. You must pay 3 MP for each target beyond the first (declare secondary targets before you roll to complete the spell). The primary target suffers 3d6 + Magic penetrating damage, while secondary targets each suffer 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage. Any target that makes a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower reduces their damage by one die (thus the primary target would suffer only 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage and secondary targets would suffer only 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage).
Cone of Cold~Primal~Attack~15~Major~17~CON (Stamina) vs.SP~Frost Weapons~You project a blast of freezing air from your outstretched hands that is 2 yards wide and 8 yards long. Anyone caught in the blast suffers 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage and a -10 penalty to Speed for a number of rounds equal to half your Magic ability. Subjects who make a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower only suffer 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage and a -5 penalty to their Speed for the same duration.
Crushing Prison~Spirit~Attack~15~Major~17~CON (Stamina) or STR (Might) vs. SP~Telekinetic Weapons~You encase one enemy within 20 yards in a contracting cage of force. The spell immediately deals 1d6 + Magic damage and the target must succeed on a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower or become immobilized. Immobilized targets cannot move, though they may make attacks and cast spells through the cage of force. They also take an additional 2d6 + Magic damage at the start of their next turn and remain immobilized until they pass a Constitution (Stamina) or Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower to break free of the cage. Targets that fail a third test take another 3d6 + Magic damage at the beginning of their next turn and remain immobilized until they break free, but suffer no additional damage on subsequent turns.
Curse of Mortality~Entropy~Attack~15~Major~19~CON (Stamina) vs SP~Death Magic~This spell forces a single enemy ever closer to its inevitable death. The subject suffers 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage initially, and 1d6 + Magic damage at the start of each of their turns. Additionally, they cannot regain Health by any means. The effects of this curse last for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. If the target makes a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower when the spell is cast, they instead suffer 1d6 penetrating damage per turn and can regain Health as usual.
Daze~Entropy~Attack~2~Major~11~WIL (Self-Discipline) vs. SP~None~You ensorcell one visible target within 10 yards. A target that makes a successful Willpower (Self-Discipline) test vs. your Spellpower is slightly confused and suffers a -1 penalty on all ability tests until the beginning of your next turn. A target that fails the test suffers the same penalty and cannot take any actions on their next turn.
Death Cloud~Entropy~Attack~20~Major~21~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Curse of Mortality~You unleash a cloud of entropic energy with a 5-yard radius centered anywhere within 50 yards. Anyone, be they ally or enemy, who enters the cloud or starts their turn in it suffers 3d6 + Magic penetrating damage. Targets who make a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower only suffer 2d6 penetrating damage. This spell normally lasts for one round but for 10 MP, paid at the start of your subsequent turns as a free action, you may extend the duration by an additional round.
Death Hex~Entropy~Attack~17~Major~19~MAG (Entropy) or WIL (Morale) vs. SP~Misdirection Hex~You curse an enemy within 30 yards to suffer mightily from each strike upon them. Until the end of the encounter, all attacks made against the target gain a +3 bonus, deal +3 damage, and automatically generate +2 SP on a hit, even if doubles aren't rolled. The subject can end the effects with a successful Magic (Entropy) or Willpower (Morale) test vs. your Spellpower, made on its turn. The spell otherwise ends after a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability.
Death Magic~Entropy~Enhancement~7~Major~15~None~Drain Life~You draw upon the residual life force of the dying to replenish your own. Any living creature that dies within 6 yards of you while this spell is active heals damage to your Health equal to the creature's Constitution, with a minimum of 1. It cannot bring you above your unwounded Health, however. Death magic lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. This spell and death syphon are mutually exclusive, and cannot be maintained at the same time. Casting one cancels the other.
Death Syphon~Spirit~Utility~7~Major~15~None~Walking Bomb~You draw upon nearby entropic energy to replenish your own mana. Any living creature that dies within 6 yards of you while this spell is active restores a number of your spent mana points equal to the creature's Magic, with a minimum of 1. It cannot bring you above your normal full complement of mana points. Death syphon lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. This spell and death magic are mutually exclusive, and cannot be maintained at the same time. Casting one cancels the other.
Decompose~Entropy~Utility~5~1min (4R)~12~None~Entropy Magic Talent (Journeyman)~By tracing mystic glyphs over the subject, which may be any single piece of non-living organic material, you speed up the natural process of its decay. Once your casting is finished, every second that passes is the equivalent of a day for the subject. So in a minute's time, it decays as if two months have passed. In an hour, it decays nearly ten years! This continues until the object is reduced to dust. You can halt the decomposition with a glyph of preservation, but the subject decays some ten months in just the time it takes to cast that spell, and if the glyph of preservation wears off the accelerated decay continues where it left off, at the same rate. Decompose can't be dispelled; its effects are permanent.
Dispel Magic~Spirit~Utility~8~Major~17~MAG (Spirit) vs. SP~Spell Shield~You remove all magical spell effects from a chosen visible target within 25 yards of you. Roll a test of your Magic (Spirit) vs. the Spellpower of any affected magic. Success means you remove that magic. Failure means you do not remove that magic, as it is too powerful. Make a single roll for all magic affecting the target; you may remove some effects and not others, based on their varying Spellpowers. The Gamemaster may rule that some magical effects not from spells can be affected by dispel magic, in which case an effective Spellpower is assigned to represent the effect's resistance to being dispelled.
Dowse~Spirit~Utility~10~1min (4R)~17~None~Spirit Magic Talent (Journeyman)~You extend your senses throughout a 100-yard radius in order to locate a desired object. This spell may be used to locate any one of a type of item (for example, a nearby source of clean water or the nearest item of jewelry) or one particular item (for example, the Cauld Creek or your uncle's lost signet ring). You must be familiar enough to picture in mind any specific item you intend to find with this spell. The GM may immediately reveal the location of the object, if it is within range, or grant you 5 SPs to spend immediately on exploration stunts.
Drain Life~Entropy~Utility~4~Major~12~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~None~You suck life energy out of a visible target within 10 yards to heal yourself. The target takes 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage and you are healed by the same amount. Note this only heals damage you have suffered; it doesn't give you bonus Health above your normal amount. If the target makes a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower, the penetrating damage is only 1d6.
Dream Sending~Spirit~Utility~7~5min (20R)~15~None~Spirit Magic Talent (Journeyman)~You send a dream across the Fade to a particular subject, who must be known to you. When the subject next dreams, it will be the dream you have sent. You can script the general events of the dream, including things like conversations, but you do not become aware of the subject's reactions and are not truly interacting with them. You can use a dream sending to carry a message or convey information, or to display imagery meant to incite emotional reactions.^^Generally, the content of a dream sending cannot be longer than an hour or so. While the dream may influence the subject's decision making (providing a particular omen or key piece of information, for example) it does not exert any direct power over the subject's mind or will. Dream sending does not work on subjects that do not dream, such as dwarves or the Tranquil.
Earthquake~Primal~Attack~11~Major~17~DEX (Acrobatics) vs. SP~Stonefist~The ground bucks and rolls in an area with a 6-yard radius anywhere you choose within 30 yards. Anyone caught in the area suffers a -2 penalty to Defense and a -5 penalty to Speed for one round. They must also succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower or fall prone. This spell normally lasts for one round but for 5 MP, paid at the start of your subsequent turns as a free action, you may extend the duration by an additional round.
Elemental Mastery~Primal~Enhancement~5~Major~15~None~Primal Magic Talent (Master)~You strengthen your ties with the primal forces of the elements. For one minute, you add +2 to the damage of any Primal attack spell you cast. This includes damage dealt through an intermediary object, as with flaming weapons and frost weapons. You can extend the spell's duration when you cast it by spending an additional 4 MP per additional minute you would like it to last.
Ensnare~Primal~Attack~8~Major~17~STR (Might) vs. SP~Keeper Specialization (Journeyman)~You send out tendrils of raw nature magic that pull enemies towards you. You can target a number of enemies up to your Magic ability who are each within 8 yards of you. Each target must make a successful Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower or be pulled adjacent to you (or as close to adjacent as terrain and other obstructions allow). Targets that fail the roll and get 1, 2, or 3 on their Dragon Die also take penetrating damage equal to half your Magic as the tendrils lash and squeeze.
Entropic Cloud~Entropy~Enhancement~20~Major~19~MAG (Entropy) vs. SP~Entropy Magic Talent (Master)~The chaos of battle is yours to command as you extend a cloud of entropic energy 20 yards in radius from your own body. Allies in the cloud enjoy a +2 bonus to all attacks and receive +1 SP on all rolls that generate stunt points. Enemies in the cloud receive a -2 penalty to all attacks and -1 SP on all rolls that generate stunt points unless they succeed at a Magic (Entropy) test vs. your Spellpower. This spell lasts until the end of the encounter.
Fade Shield~Spirit~Defense~6~Major~15~None~Arcane Shield~Shifting partway into the Fade enhances your arcane defenses. For one round, your Spellpower increases by +2 and your Defense becomes equal to your Spellpower. You can extend the spell's effect when you cast it by spending 2 MP per additional round you would like it to last.
Fireball~Primal~Attack~11~Major~17~DEX (Acrobatics) vs. SP~Flaming Weapons~You throw a mote of fire to a point anywhere within 50 yards, where it erupts into a ball of flame with a 4-yard radius. Anyone caught in the blast takes 3d6 + Magic damage and may be knocked prone; those who make a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower remain standing.
Fist of the Maker~Spirit~Attack~5~Major~15~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Force Mage Specialization~You slam your enemies to the ground with magical force. You create a circular blast with a 4-yard radius that's centered anywhere within 24 yards that you can see. Those caught in the blast are knocked prone and take 1d6 penetrating damage. Targets that make a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower are only knocked prone.
Flame Blast~Primal~Attack~3~Major~12~DEX (Acrobatics) vs. SP~None~Gouts of blazing fire erupt from your outstretched hands, burning nearby targets. The flame blast is 8 yards long and 2 yards wide. Anyone hit by the blast takes 2d6+1 damage. Targets that make a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower only take 1d6+1 damage.
Flaming Weapons~Primal~Enhancement~6~Major~15~None~Flame Blast~The readied melee weapons of allies within 10 yards of you burst into flames, and inflict an additional 1d6 damage with each successful attack. This last for one minute; you can extend this duration when you cast the spell by spending an additional 3 MP per additional minute you would like it to last. This spell does not harm the weapons it affects and may be cast on frost weapons.
Force Field~Spirit~Defense~10~Major~18~None~Mind Blast~You surround a subject within 25 yards (which may be yourself) with a protective field of magical force that absorbs all damage that would otherwise affect its target. The force field lasts for one round. During that time, the subject is completely immune to damage, but also cannot move from the spot (the force field is immobile), make melee or ranged attacks, or give or receive any items. Spells and other effects that do not cause direct damage, such as daze, mana drain, or vulnerability hex, still affect the subject normally, and spells pass out of the force field normally. You can extend the spell's effect when you cast it by spending 5 MP per additional round you would like it to last.
Frost Weapons~Primal~Enhancement~6~Major~15~None~Winter's Grasp~The readied melee weapon of all allies within 10 yards of you exude freezing cold, inflicting +2 penetrating damage with each successful attack. The freezing cold lasts for one minute; you can extend this duration when you cast the spell by spending an additional 3 MP per additional minute you would like it to last. This spell does not harm the weapons it affects and may be cast on flaming weapons. Only the additional damage is penetrating.
Glyph of Neutralization~Creation~Utility~20~1min (4R)~17~MAG (Creation) vs. SP~Glyph of Repulsion~The bane of all mages, this magical glyph saps mana from a target and temporarily prevents them from casting spells. The first enemy that moves within 2 yards of the glyph's location triggers it. The target and anyone within 10 yards is drained of 3d6 + Magic MP and must succeed at a Magic (Creation) test vs. your Spellpower or lose the ability to cast spells for 1d3 rounds. You can maintain a number of active glyphs of neutralization equal to your Magic ability at any one time. Each glyph is good for only one use.
Glyph of Repulsion~Creation~Attack~10~Major~15~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Glyph of Warding~You trace a hasty arcane symbol onto the ground in front of you and strike it with all your might, causing a wave of force to send enemies within 10 yards reeling. All enemies are pushed 10 yards away from you and must succeed at a Constitution (Stamina) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower or be knocked prone.
Glyph of Paralysis~Creation~Attack~3~1min (4R)~10~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~None~You trace your fingers on the ground, creating an invisible glyph that holds a charge of magical power. The first enemy that moves within 2 yards of the glyph's location triggers it. The target must make a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. Spellpower or become paralyzed for 1d3 rounds. A paralyzed character can take no actions and has a Defense of 7. You can maintain a number of glyphs of paralysis equal to your Magic ability at any one time. Each glyph is good for one use.
Glyph of Preservation~Creation~Utility~1~5min (20R)~10~None~None~You draw a faint glyph on the surface of the subject, which can be any piece of dead organic material. The spell arrests the process of decay for the material, keeping it as fresh as it was when the glyph was inscribed for a month. A glyph of preservation can be renewed during its duration, which extends its affects for another month. When the glyph expires the process of decay begins again from where it left off. The spell is used to preserve foodstuffs, to preserve corpses (for lying in state or dissection), or to protect valuable items made of wood, paper, or leather.
Glyph of Sealing~Creation~Utility~3~1min (4R)~11~None~None~You touch any object that closes, from a door or gate to a jar, drawing a faint glyph that connects its two surfaces. Once the glyph of sealing is complete, the object is held closed and only you or someone you designated when casting the spell may open it. For anyone else, the only way to open the seal is by breaking whatever it is inscribed upon, whether smashing open a jar or breaking down a door. The glyph lasts until the object is opened, after which it must be recast to seal the object again (assuming it is not destroyed in the process).
Glyph of Warding~Creation~Defense~5~Major~15~None~Glyph of Paralysis~You trace an arcane glyph on the ground where you stand with your hand or staff. Allies within 3 yards of the glyph of warding gain a +2 bonus to Willpower tests and their Defense against ranged attacks so long as they remain within the glyph's area. A glyph lasts until the end of the current encounter. You can maintain a number of different glyphs of warding equal to your Magic at any one time (although this does not allow the effects of multiple glyphs of warding to stack on the same target).
Grease~Creation~Utility~7~Major~15~DEX (Acrobatics) vs. SP~Spell Wisp~You create a slick of grease covering an area up to 10 yards in diameter anywhere within 30 yards of you. Anyone within the slick when it is cast, anyone entering the area, and anyone who moves within the area must make a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) test against your Spellpower or fall prone at each of those times, as they apply. Prone characters may crawl normally.^^The grease created by this spell is flammable; contact with fire ignites it, immediately causing 1d6 penetrating damage to everyone in the area. A grease fire burns for rounds equal to your Magic before burning out (which expends the grease), and those inside the area take 1d6 penetrating damage on their turn each round until they exit it. A slick that is not burned persists indefinitely, dispersing only in rain, when appropriately provisioned characters scour it away, or in similar conditions.
Group Heal~Creation~Utility~3~Major~15~None~Spirit Healer Specialization~A number of subjects equal to twice your Magic, all of whom must be within 10 yards of you, regain 1d6 Health per 3 MP spent on the casting (maximum: 3d6 Health for 9 MP). You may make yourself one of the spell's subjects.
Hallucination~Entropy~Attack~15~1min (4R)~15~PER (Hearing, Smelling, Seeing) vs. SP~Entropy Magic Talent (Journeyman)~You conjure, in the mind of a subject within 30 yards, an optical, auditory, and olfactory hallucination that can appear to be no wider or taller than your Magic ability in yards. Add additional targets for 5 MP each. Targets must succeed at a Perception (Hearing, Seeing, or Smelling) test vs. your Spellpower to realize the illusory nature of the sight. "Touching" the hallucination automatically reveals the ruse but does not end the spell unless you want it to. The hallucination lasts for as long as you spend free actions to concentrate on it.
Haste~Creation~Enhancement~10~Major~17~None~Heroic Defense~This spell turns a single ally into a blur on the battlefield, allowing them to move and strike with blinding speed. The subject gains a +10 bonus to their Speed, treats the Lightning Attack stunt as having a cost of 2 SP, and may buy the stunt multiple times to make multiple extra attacks in one round. None of these extra attacks can generate stunt points.^^Haste only lasts for a single round unless its duration is extended at a cost of 10 MP per additional round, paid as a free action at the beginning of the caster's subsequent turns. You may cast this spell on yourself.
Heal~Creation~Utility~1~Major~10~None~None~Your touch seals wounds and restores vigor to one wounded target. You can choose to spend up to 3 mana points when you cast this spell. For each mana point spent, the target gets back 1d6 Health. You can cast this on yourself.
Hemorrhage~Blood~Attack~15~Major~19~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Blood Wound~You take control of a large volume of a target's blood and force it out through their mouth, nose, and eyes. unless they succeed at a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower. If the target fails the test it takes 4d6 + Magic penetrating damage; if it succeeds it suffers only 2d6 penetrating damage. Regardless of whether the target succeeds, the horrific nature of this spell may demoralize enemies; the Imposing Spell stunt only costs 2 SP when used while casting hemorrhage. The target of this spell must be within 50 yards and visible to you.
Heroic Aura~Creation~Defense~6~Major~15~None~Heroic Offense~This spell surrounds a subject within 30 yards with an arcane aura that deflects incoming attacks. The subject gains a +2 bonus to Defense for the rest of the encounter. You can cast this spell on yourself. Its effects do not stack with those of spells that reset your Defense to be based on your Spellpower, such as Arcane Shield and Fade Shield.
Heroic Defense~Creation~Defense~8~Major~15~None~Heroic Aura~You surround an ally within 30 yards with bands of protective force that stop all but the most devastating attacks. The subject gains a +5 bonus to Defense and a +2 bonus to Armor Rating for a number of rounds equal to half your Magic score. You can extend this duration at the cost of 4 MP per additional round, paid on the start of your subsequent turns as a free action.^^You can cast this spell on yourself. Its effects do not stack with those that adjust your Defense to be based on your Spellpower, such as arcane shield and fade shield.
Heroic Offense~Creation~Enhancement~3~Major~11~None~None~Your touch fills one ally with magical might. Until the end of the encounter, the target gains a +1 bonus to Strength.
Horror~Entropy~Attack~8~Major~17~WIL (Courage) vs. SP~Daze~You overwhelm a visible target within 20 yards with a blast of sheer terror. Until the target succeeds on a Willpower (Courage) test vs. your Spellpower, they can do nothing but cower in fear. A target failing the initial test may try again at the start of each of their turns.
Invigorate~Spirit~Enhancement~4~Major~14~None~Mana Drain~You emit waves of mana, bolstering your allies. Allies within 10 yards of you get +1 SP whenever they generate stunt points. You may spend 1 MP at the start of each of your turns to extend the effects for another round; otherwise they end at the beginning of your turn.
Inferno~Primal~Attack~20~Major~19~DEX (Acrobatics) vs. SP~Fireball~Calling upon the raw elements of creation, you ignite a column of air 6 yards in radius and 12 yards tall anywhere within 50 yards. Anyone, whether ally or enemy, who enters the inferno or starts their turn in it, suffers 3d6 + Magic damage. Targets who make a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower suffer only 2d6 damage but fall prone. Additionally, any target that leaves the column of fire continues to burn, taking 1d6 damage at the start of their turn until they succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower to put out the flames. The column normally lasts a single round, but you can extend its duration another round by spending 10 MP at the start of your subsequent turns as a free action.
Large Animal Form~Creation~Utility~10~Major~12~None~Shapeshifter Specialization (Journeyman)~You transform yourself into a large animal for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. You can extend the spell for the cost of 3 MP per additional round. You retain your own Cunning, Magic, and Willpower but otherwise your stats are those of the animal. Black bears, brontos, Mabari war dogs are examples of large animals. GMs may create similar stats for others.
Levitate~Spirit~Utility~5~Major~15~STR (Might) vs. MAG (Spirit)~Mind Blast~You exert telekinetic force to move an inanimate object. When cast, split your Magic score as you wish between the STR and DEX the object will have as you manipulate it. Neither can be less than 0. If your Magic is negative, both are 0.^^The object must be visible to you at all times to manipulate it. You can move the object with a Speed of your (Magic x 3), minimum of 1. If the object is being held, its holder may make an opposed STR (Might) vs. MAG (Spirit) test. If successful, your spell ends. At the start of your turn each round, you may spend 1 MP to maintain the spell.^^Moving the object is a minor action, unless you do something like attack with a levitating weapon. Attack rolls use the STR or DEX assigned when you cast the spell (depending on the type of weapon or object being animated), except you use your Spirit focus. Most objects do damage as improvised weapons. Weapons do their regular damage only if you have that weapon group.
Life Ward~Creation~Utility~5~Major~16~None~Spirit Healer Specialization (Master)~You weave a protective ward of mystic energy around one ally within 6 yards of you, or around yourself. The first time the target's Health drops below 10 in this encounter, they immediately regain 2d6 Health. Life ward only works once per casting and it ends at the end of the encounter if not triggered. A character cannot have more than one life ward on them at the same time.
Lightning~Primal~Attack~6~Major~16~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Shock~A bolt of electricity leaps from your outstretched hand or staff to strike a single target within 30 yards. The bolt inflicts 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage. Targets who make a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower take 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage instead.
Lingering Mark~Entropy~Attack~21~Major~19~MAG (Entropy) or WIL (Morale) vs. SP~Necromancer Specialization, Entropy Talent (Journeyman), Spirit Mark~You mark an enemy within 40 yards so that spirits will assault them, doing ongoing damage. Until the end of the encounter, the subject takes 2d6 + your Willpower Penetrating Damage per turn. The subject can end the effects with a successful Magic (Entropy) or Willpower (Morale) test vs. your Spellpower, made on its turn. The spell otherwise ends after a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability.^^If a target dies while the lingering mark is on them, their spirit will arise to fight for the caster for a time. The spirit has all the normal statistics of the deceased but gains +2 to attack and damage. These spirits ignore the effects of terrain and normally only magical attacks (spells or hits from magical weapons) can harm them, other attacks passing through without effect. The spirits fight for the caster for turns equal to the caster's Willpower x 2.
Mana Cleanse~Spirit~Defense~7~Major~17~None~Mana Drain~You use your own mana to block that of other casters. For the duration of the encounter, if someone spends mana points in a 16-yard radius of you, you can spend your own mana points to negate their spell on a 1-for-1 basis. For example, if another mage spends 4 MP to cast a spell within 16 yards of you, you can spend 4 MP to negate that spell. If you do not have enough mana points to counter the entire cost, your spell has no effect. This spell does not reveal which spell the other mage is trying to cast; only how many MP are being spent to fuel it.
Mana Clash~Spirit~Attack~10~Major~19~MAG (Spirit) vs. SP~Spell Might~You sacrifice personal magical reserves to burn out an enemy's mana. One target within 30 yards suffers 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage. Additionally, for every 2 MP you spend beyond the initial cost of this spell, the target loses 2 MP and suffers an additional 1 penetrating damage. If the subject makes a successful Magic (Spirit) test vs. your Spellpower, they take no additional damage for the mana drain but still take the initial 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage and lose the mana you paid to burn. This spell has no effect on targets without mana.
Mana Drain~Spirit~Utility~3~Major~12~MAG (Spirit) vs. SP~None~You create a parasitic bond with a visible spellcasting target within 30 yards unless the target makes a successful Magic (Spirit) test vs. your Spellpower. Until the end of the encounter, an affected target must spend 1 extra mana point each time he casts a spell and each time this happens you gain 1 mana point.
Mass Paralysis~Entropy~Attack~22~Major~21~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Miasma~You surround each enemy within 20 yards with tendrils of entropic energy, all but locking them in place. Each target must succeed at a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower or become paralyzed. Targets that pass this initial test lose their Dexterity rating from their Speed until they pass the test again or the spell expires. Paralyzed characters have a Speed of 2 yards per turn, lose their Dexterity factor to Defense, and can take no actions, but are not subject to a coup de grace unless they would otherwise be vulnerable. A paralyzed target makes a new test at the start of their turn each round to shake off the spell. Effects otherwise persist for a number of rounds equal to your Magic.
Mass Rejuvenation~Creation~Utility~10~Major~17~None~Rejuvenate~You channel healing energy to a number of allies within 10 yards equal to twice your Magic score, though each subject beyond the first costs an additional 5 MP. You may target yourself. Subjects each regain 1d6 Health immediately, and another 1d6 Health at the start of their respective turns each round for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability.
Miasma~Entropy~Attack~8~Major~15~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Paralyze~A sickly green mist radiates out along the ground from your feet. All enemies within 10 yards of you at the start of their turns must make a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower or suffer a -2 penalty to Defense and a -2 penalty to all attacks. Subjects must make this test each turn they begin in the miasma or upon entering the miasma. This spell lasts one round unless you extend its duration another round by spending 2 MP as a free action at the start of your subsequent turns.
Memory~Spirit~Utility~6~Major~16~WIL (Self-Discipline vs. SP~Mind Blast~You touch a target and cause them to either forget or recall a specific memory. You can remove a memory within a number of hours of the event in question equal to your Magic, but the spell can restore a memory of any age, so long as it is the memory of an event the subject actually experienced. The subject makes a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test against your Spellpower to resist losing a memory, but there is no test to restore a lost memory.^^The GM decides on the appropriate length of the affected memory, but it should generally concern a single incident or experience no longer than the caster's Magic in hours (and likely much less).
Mind Blast~Spirit~Attack~3~Major~12~STR (Might) vs. SP~None~You create a circular blast of telekinetic force with a 2 yard radius that's centered anywhere within 50 yards that you can see. Those caught in the blast are knocked prone and cannot take a major action on their next turn. Targets that make a successful Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower are only knocked prone. In either case, any prepared actions are lost.
Misdirection Hex~Entropy~Attack~10~Major~15~MAG (Entropy) or WIL (Courage) vs. SP~Affliction Hex~Fortune turns against the subject of this spell at every opportunity, making their attacks all but fruitless. Until the end of the encounter, a single enemy within 30 yards suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and cannot generate stunt points. The subject may make a Magic (Entropy) or Willpower (Courage) test vs. your Spellpower as a free action at the start of each of their turns to end the spell. Otherwise, the effects end after a number of rounds equal to your Magic.
Paralyze~Entropy~Attack~7~Major~16~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Weakness~Ghostly wisps of entropic energy surround an opponent within 30 yards. A target failing a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower is paralyzed, completely unable to move, while a successful test means the target's Speed is cut by onequarter (rounded in the target's favor). Both effects last for the rest of the encounter. A paralyzed target gets a new test at the start of their turn each round. Paralyzed characters lose the Dexterity bonus to their Defense and can obviously take no actions, but are not subject to a coup de grace unless they are otherwise unconscious or dying.
Petrify~Primal~Attack~15~Major~19~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Earthquake~You turn a single target within 30 yards to stone unless they succeed on a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower. A petrified character gains a +5 Armor Rating, but has their Defense reduced to 7 and may take no actions on their turn. They are not subject to a coup de grace. Petrified subjects may take no actions except to reattempt their test at the start of their turns until they succeed and overcome the spell.
Pit~Primal~Utility~14~Major~15~DEX (Acrobatics) vs. SP~Primal Magic Talent (Journeyman)~You magically carve a pit into the bare earth or nearby stone, up to 4 yards long by 4 yards wide by 4 yards deep. Subjects standing on the affected ground must succeed at a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower or fall prone into the pit. Climbing out of the pit requires a minor action.
Pull of the Abyss~Spirit~Attack~8~Major~17~STR (Might) vs. SP~Force Mage Specialization, Telekentic Burst~You use telekinetic force to cluster your enemies together and slow them down. You create a circular area of force with a 6-yard radius that's centered anywhere within 30 yards of you. Those caught inside must make a successful Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower or be pulled to the center of the area (or as close as terrain and other obstructions allow). Affected enemies cannot run, have their Speed reduced by 6, and suffer a -2 penalty to attack and spell casting rolls for 1 round. Those that make the test are not moved but do suffer a -1 penalty to attack and spell casting rolls for 1 round.
Regeneration~Creation~Utility~15~1hr~15~None~Creation Magic Talent (Master)~Grievous wounds close and broken bones knit together as you speed up a subject's natural healing to accomplish in an hour what would normally take weeks. The subject regains 3d6 + your Magic in Health and is cured of any major injuries, such as broken bones or damaged organs. Powerful as this spell is, it cannot be used to reattach severed body parts. It is also unable to cure diseases or neutralize poisons, though it can counteract some symptoms and repair organ damage suffered.
Rejuvenate~Creation~Utility~5~Major~15~None~Heal~You channel regenerative energy to an ally within 10 yards. The subject regains 1d6 Health immediately, and another 1d6 Health at the start of their turn each round for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability.
Repulsion Field~Spirit~Defense~6~Major~16~STR (Might) vs. SP~Force Field~This spell surrounds you with a field of energy that pushes foes away from you. Every other round, at the end of your turn, beginning on the round you cast the spell, a wave of repulsive energy surges out. Enemies within 6 yards must make a successful Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower or be pushed 4 yards away from you and knocked prone. To maintain this spell you must spend 1 MP at the start of each of your turns, even on the rounds when no wave surges out. You may not cast this spell twice in order to generate a wave each round.
Revival~Creation~Utility~5~Major~14~None~ Spirit Healer Specialization (Journeyman)~Your touch helps to restore the fallen. A dying subject adjacent to you immediately regains 10 + their Constitution + your Magic in Health. Since dying characters cannot take actions, you cannot cast this spell on yourself.
Rock Armor~Primal~Defense~3~1min (4R)~10~None~None~Your skin becomes as hard as stone and protects you from harm. Rock armor has an Armor Rating equal to your Magic ability. The spell lasts for 1 hour but its duration can be extended by spending additional mana points. For each additional MP spent beyond the first 3, rock armor remains in effect for another hour, to a maximum of 6 hours total. A mage wearing regular armor gains no benefit from this spell. You can only cast this on yourself.
Shape Earth~Creation~Utility~6~Major~15~None~Creation Magic Talent (Journeyman)~You can shape and move a mass of sand, earth, or even stone within 6 yards. The spell allows you to move earthen materials with an effective Strength equal to twice your Magic. The materials do not levitate, but are pushed or pulled along the ground. The GM determines how fast objects can be moved based on their mass and your effective Strength. You can also mold objects as if they were soft clay, shaping them as you direct. The GM may require a Magic (Creation) test if you want to finesse a particular result, especially if any fine detail is involved. To maintain this spell you must spend 1 MP at the start of each of your turns.^^Once you stop maintaining the spell, the materials stay where they are, subject to the usual natural forces (like gravity). Shaped stone will typically retain its new shape, so long as it is capable of supporting its own weight.
Shelter~Primal~Utility~2~Major~12~None~Primal Magic Talent (Novice)~A glyph traced upon the earth with hand or staff creates a faintly shimmering dome, up to 6 yards across and up to 3 yards high at the center. The environment within the dome is cool, dry, and comfortable regardless of the weather outside. Rain, snow, and other minor debris (including falling leaves, ash, or smoke) are kept out, though fresh air can penetrate the dome, and smoke-such as from a campfire-can escape. The shelter's barrier is of no use whatsoever in combat. You can control the light level within from shade (slightly darker than the outside) to lit as brightly as by a lantern. The shelter lasts for up to 12 hours, or until you dismiss it. You can only maintain a single shelter at a time.
Shock~Primal~Attack~4~Major~13~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~None~Electricity arcs from your hands or the end of your staff, shocking enemies in a 6-yard by 6-yard area. Anyone in this area takes 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage. Targets that make a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower only take 1d6 penetrating damage.
Sleep~Entropy~Attack~15~Major~19~WIL (Self-Discpline) vs. SP~Horror~Enemies within 10 yards of a point you choose within 30 yards of you are overcome with heavy drowsiness, falling asleep on their feet unless they succeed at a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test vs. your Spellpower. Targets that fail the initial test may make another test on each of their turns until they awaken. Sleeping targets have a Defense of 10, but are not subject to a coup de grace. Any damage immediately awakens a subject.
Small Animal Form~Creation~Utility~5~Major~12~None~Shapeshifter Specialization~You transform yourself into a small animal for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. You can extend the spell for the cost of 1 MP per additional round. You retain your own Cunning, Magic, and Willpower but otherwise your stats are those of the animal. Dogs and falcons are examples of small animals. GMs may create similar stats for others.
Spell Might~Spirit~Enhancement~11~Major~15~None~Mana Cleanse~You channel deep reserves of magical energy, granting yourself +2 to Spellpower and gaining +2 SP on all rolls that generate stunt points until the end of the encounter. While under the effects of this spell, each additional spell you cast costs an additional 2 MP. You may end this spell as a free action at the beginning of your turn.
Spell Shield~Spirit~Defense~4~Major~13~None~None~You use your own magical power to protect yourself from the spells of others. The spell shield lasts a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. During that time any spell (helpful or harmful) cast on you has no effect, but you must spend mana points equal to the spell's base mana cost (not counting deductions for spell stunts or talents). An arcane bolt cast at you would cause no damage, for example, but you would have to spend 2 MP (the spell's mana cost). If it's a spell that affects multiple targets, you are not affected but others are as normal. If you do not have enough mana points left to pay the cost, the spell shield ends and the spell affects you as normal.
Spell Wisp~Creation~Utility~3~1min (4R)~11~None~None~You summon a small wisp that floats near you for up to an hour and boosts the power of your spells. While the wisp is aiding you, you gain a +1 bonus to your Spellpower. The wisp itself is insubstantial and cannot be attacked or touched.
Spellbloom~Creation~Utility~8~Major~15~None~Grease~You conjure a font of magical energy with a 4-yard radius centered anywhere within 50 yards that you can see, and that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. Each mage, whether ally or enemy, inside the spellbloom at the beginning of their turn, regains 1d6 MP. As a free action on your turn you may dispel the bloom to gain a number of SP equal to the rounds of duration remaining on it. These SP must be used on spell stunts on the same round they are gained. Any unspent points are lost at the end of your turn
Spirit Mark~Entropy~Attack~18~Major~17~MAG (Entropy) or WIL (Morale) vs. SP~Necromancer Specialization~You mark an enemy within 30 yards so that spirits will assault them, doing ongoing damage. Until the end of the encounter, the subject takes 1d6 + the Caster's Willpower Penetrating Damage per turn. The subject can end the effects with a successful Magic (Entropy) or Willpower (Morale) test vs. your Spellpower, made on its turn. Otherwise the spell ends after a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability.^^If a target dies while the Spirit Mark is on them, their spirit will arise to fight for the caster for a brief time. The spirit has all the normal statistics of the deceased, but they ignore the effects of terrain, and only magical attacks (spells or hits from magical weapons) can harm them. Other attacks pass through their forms without effect. The spirits fight for the caster for turns equal to the caster's Willpower before they depart.
Stinging Swarm~Creation~Attack~20~Major~17~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Spellbloom~A swarm of biting insects materializes around a single enemy within 30 yards. The subject takes 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage at the start of each of their turns for a number of rounds equal to half your Magic ability. They must also succeed at a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower each round or suffer a -2 penalty to all attacks and spellcasting tests. If the subject dies before the swarm dissipates, the swarm moves on to another enemy within 20 yards.
Stone's Embrace~Primal~Attack~15~Major~17~STR (Might) vs. Spellpower~Pit~The earth swallows up and traps the feet of a number of enemies up to your Magic ability within 30 yards unless they succeed at a Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower. If they fail, they remain trapped until they succeed at the test as a minor action on their turn.
Stone's Throw~Primal~Utility~4~Major~13~None~Ensnare~You disappear into the earth or stone under your feet and reappear anywhere within 24 yards, erupting from below without warning. This is not teleportation; you are traveling through the ground. There must be uninterrupted earth or stone between your starting and ending points (you could not get from one wooden rooftop to another with this spell, for example), but most mortar is as good as stone for traveling within stone structures.
Spring~Creation~Utility~4~1min (4R)~13~None~Creation Magic Talent (Journeyman)~Tracing magical glyphs on natural earth or stone, then striking them with your hand or staff, you cause a spring to burst forth from the spot, pouring out water at a rate of your Magic in gallons per minute. The water is fresh, clean, drinkable, and entirely mundane-it pours and evaporates naturally. If the spring forms in a hollow, it fills to become a pool. You may stop the flow of the spring at any time. Otherwise, it lasts a number of hours equal to your Magic before stopping of its own accord.
Stonefist~Primal~Attack~3~Major~11~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~None~You hurl a magical rock at a visible enemy up to 20 yards away. The rock inflicts 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage and the target is knocked prone. If the target makes a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower, the spell only inflicts 1d6 penetrating damage and remains standing.
Summon Beasts~Creation~Utility~22~1hr~17~MAG (Entropy) vs. SP~Creation Magic Talent (Journeyman)~You summon a mundane wild animal from the local area, which remains loyal to you until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. The animal understands your spoken commands and follows them to the best of its ability. Though you may specify the type of animal, the Game Master is the arbiter of what type of animals are available to answer. Summoned animals do not fight to the death and are likely to flee when they've lost more than half of their Health (at the GM's discretion) unless you succeed on a Communication (Leadership) test to keep the beast around, or the animal succeeds on a Willpower (Morale) test. The TN of these tests depends on how dire the situation is but should rarely be less than TN 13.
Telekinetic Burst~Spirit~Attack~5~Major~15~STR (Might) vs. SP~Fist of the Maker~You create a circular burst of force with a 4-yard radius that's centered anywhere within 24 yards that you can see. Those caught inside must make a successful Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower or be thrown to the nearest edge of the burst and knocked prone. Targets may take damage from terrain and hazards depending on the situation. A burst that sends enemies flying into a wall inflicts 1d6 damage if the wall is wood and 2d6 damage if the wall is stone, for example. The GM determines what damage, if any, is applied. Those that make the test are not moved but are still knocked prone. 
Telekinetic Weapons~Spirit~Enhancement~8~Major~17~None~Force Field~The readied melee weapons of all allies within 10 yards of you pulse with arcane force. Affected weapons inflict bonus damage equal to your Magic ability. Any attack made with an affected weapon that generates stunt points may treat the Pierce Armor stunt as costing 1 fewer SP. (This can be combined with other effects, such as the level 2 Rogue stunt bonus, to reduce the cost of the stunt to 0 SP.) The enchantment lasts for one minute, but you can extend the duration when you cast the spell by spending an additional 6 MP for each extra minute you would like it to last. This spell does not harm the weapons it affects and may be cast on weapons currently subject to the spells frost weapon and flaming weapon.
Tempest~Primal~Attack~11~Major~17~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Lightning~You create a small electrical storm centered anywhere within 40 yards, with a radius of 4 yards. Anyone in the storm's area suffers 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage from lightning. Targets that make a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower only suffer 1d6 penetrating damage. The storm only lasts a single round, but you may extend its duration another round by spending 10 MP as a free action at the start of your subsequent turns. If you extend the spell, all creatures in the radius immediately suffer its effects again.
Thought-Taking~Blood~Attack~15~1min (4R)~17~WIL (Self-Discipline) vs. SP~Blood Mage Specialization~This spell allows a blood mage to probe deep into a target's thoughts, uncovering their deepest secrets, desires, and fears. You must touch a target's forehead and concentrate for one minute, during which time the target makes a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test vs. your Spellpower. If they succeed, you fail to penetrate their mind but you may spend another 5 MP to extend the casting time by another minute and force the target to make the test again. Once a target fails the test, you have access to their mind and may expend 2 MP to ask the Game Master for the target's honest answer to a single question. You may ask a total number of questions equal to your Magic ability, at a rate of one question per minute. This spell is often quite painful for the target even though it deals no actual damage.
Vicious Beast Form~Creation~Utility~25~Major~12~None~Shapeshifter Specilization (Master)~You transform yourself into a vicious beast for a number of minutes equal to your Magic ability. You can extend the spell for the cost of 10 MP per additional minute. You retain your own Cunning, Magic, and Willpower but otherwise your stats are those of the beast. Giant spiders and drakes from the are examples of vicious beasts appropriate for this spell. GMs may create similar stats for others. It is beyond the power of this spell to grant the caster the form of creatures like high dragons or varterral.
Virulent Walking Bomb~Spirit~Attack~13~Major~17~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Death Syphon~You infect the blood of a target within 10 yards with deadly magical venom. When first cast, this spell immediately deals 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage. The subject must then make a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower at the start of each of its turns. If it succeeds, the spell ends. If it fails, the target suffers another 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage. If the target dies while virulent walking bomb is still in effect, it explodes in a shower of gore, dealing 2d6 damage to anyone within 4 yards. Subjects caught in this blast must succeed at a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower -2 or become secondary targets of this spell, suffering 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage on each of their turns until they succeed on the test. Secondary targets do not infect additional targets.
Vulnerability Hex~Entropy~Attack~4~Major~12~MAG (Entropy) vs. SP~None~You curse a visible target within 20 yards, making them more vulnerable to attacks and spells. Until the end of the encounter, the target suffers a -1 penalty to Defense and a -2 penalty on ability tests vs. Spellpower. A target that makes a successful Magic (Entropy) test vs. your Spellpower only suffers the Defense penalty. A character can only be subject to one vulnerability hex at a time.
Waking Nightmare~Entropy~Attack~20~Major~17~WIL (Self-Discipline) vs. SP~Sleep~You trap a single enemy within 20 yards in a waking nightmare. Until it succeeds at a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test vs. your Spellpower, the target falls into a fugue and attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. A target already asleep when affected by this spell takes a -3 penalty to its initial test. The target may make another test on each of its subsequent turns until it awakens.
Wrath of the Elvhen~Primal~Attack~6~Major~13~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~Keeper Specialization~Earth, wood, plant, and stone lash out against your enemies. While this spell is active, any enemy that starts its turn within 4 yards of you must make a successful Constitution (Stamina) vs. your Spellpower test or take penetrating damage equal to half your Magic ability. Spend 2 MP as a free action at the start of your turn each round to maintain this spell.
Walking Bomb~Spirit~Attack~4~Major~13~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~None~You infuse the blood of an opponent within 10 yards with a corrosive poison. The round you cast it, walking bomb inflicts 1d6+1 penetrating damage. While the spell is in effect, the target must make a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower at the start of each of their turns. If successful, the spell ends. If the test is failed, the target takes another 1d6+1 penetrating damage. Should the spell's damage reduce the target's Health to 0, they explode in a spray of blood, flesh, and bones. Anyone within 4 yards of the exploding victim takes 2d6 damage.
Weakness~Entropy~Attack~3~Major~11~MAG (Spirit) vs. SP~None~Your magic drains a visible enemy within 20 yards of energy, making them slower and more sluggish. The target suffers a -1 penalty to Strength and Dexterity and a -5 penalty to Speed for a number of rounds equal to the casting roll's Dragon Die. If the target makes a successful Magic (Spirit) test vs. your Spellpower, they only suffer the Speed penalty.
Weather Weaving~Primal~Utility~8~1hr~16~None~Primal Magic Talent (Master)~You shape and direct the weather in an area with a radius equal to your Magic in miles. You can choose any natural weather condition normally possible in the area for the given time of year (so you cannot make it snow in the middle of summer, for example, or rain in the desert). The weather forms within eight hours of your casting, so generally only limited changes are possible. You can make it warmer or colder by about 20 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degree Celsius), cause it to rain or snow (or stop doing so), or make the sky overcast or clear.^^Multiple castings (and expenditures of mana) over multiple days can extend the spell's effect, creating more dramatic shifts in the weather. Note that you do not control the weather from moment to moment. Once you have set it in motion, it follows its natural course.
Wind Weaving~Primal~Utility~5~1min (4R)~14~None~Primal Magic Talent (Novice)~You cause the wind to blow in whatever direction you wish, with force up to a stiff gust: strong enough to blow out candles and other small open flames, and to scatter light debris like leaves or paper. You can direct the wind for up to an hour, although changing its direction or intensity requires a major action each time you do so.^^Among other things, wind weaving is used to propel sailing vessels without the need to rely on the often-fickle nature of the weather, and to calm winds that might otherwise prove disruptive.
Winter's Grasp~Primal~Attack~3~Major~12~CON (Stamina) vs. SP~None~You envelop a visible target within 20 yards of you in a cloud of frost and ice that lasts a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. The round you cast it, winter's grasp inflicts 1d6 penetrating damage. While the spell is in effect, the target must make a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower at the start of each of their turns. If successful, the spell ends. If the test is failed, the target takes 1d6 penetrating damage and suffers a cumulative -2 penalty to Speed. Those killed by winter's grasp are frozen solid.
Wrack~Blood~Utility~3~1min (4R)~13~WIL (Self-Discipline) vs. SP~Blood Mage Specialization~You extend faint tendrils of entropic energy into the target of this spell, which must be within 2 yards while it is cast. So long as you concentrate you can inflict terrible, wracking pain on the subject at will. The victim must make a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test vs. your Spellpower to resist answering your questions or capitulating to your demands. A victim wracked by pain suffers a -3 penalty to all tests while it persists, though suffers no damage from the spell. You cannot have more than one wrack spell active at once.^^Wrack is a favored spell for interrogation, as it causes no real physical harm and leaves no signs or marks. Some victims injure themselves, and someone with a weak constitution may die from prolonged use, but otherwise it is far safer and more effective than conventional methods of torture. Tales of this spell and its use are one of the many reasons people fear blood mages and their powers.
